Introduction

The Apprenticeships Search and Filter App is a React-based project designed to simplify the process of discovering apprenticeship opportunities. It provides users with an interactive interface to search and filter listings by various criteria, such as Holland Code categories, hourly compensation, and a custom search term. The application integrates seamlessly with a Rails backend, retrieving apprenticeship data dynamically and presenting filtered results in real time.

This project aims to streamline the job search process for users, particularly those seeking opportunities that align with their career goals and preferences.
